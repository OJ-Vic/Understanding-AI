# Understanding-AI
Machine learning project with three parts: predicting global video game sales using regression and clustering, classifying emergency vehicles with CNNs, and analysing AI ethics. Demonstrates predictive modelling, computer vision, and responsible AI development.

This project is divided into three components, each highlighting distinct applications of machine learning. Component one focuses on predicting global video game sales using regression models such as linear, polynomial, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). It also applies clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN to uncover hidden patterns in the data. Key features such as regional sales, critic scores, and user engagement are integrated to enhance predictive accuracy, with evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R2, and silhouette scores assessing model and clustering performance. Component two develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify emergency and non-emergency vehicles. The study explores architectural designs, regularization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance while addressing challenges like class imbalance. Component three critically examines ethical considerations in artificial intelligence, emphasizing transparency, fairness, and accountability. Together, these components demonstrate practical machine learning applications and promote ethical AI practices in real-world scenarios.
